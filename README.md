# Stormwater-Management-Model

ORD Stormwater Management Model (aka "SWMM")


# Introduction
This project is forked from https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/Stormwater-Management-Model (OWA-SMWW5), which is the open source SWMM source code repository maintained by the Open Water Analytics group. 

This project enchanced OWA-SWMM5 by exposing functions to Java by using JNI (Java Native Interface). 

A Java toolkit to access these the interfaces is available at https://github.com/zhangmingda/swmm4j.
